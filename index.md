# Maritime Resource Name Registry
Welcome to Maritime Resource Name Registry. This page provides up to date information about Maritime Resource Names and the usage of them within the maritime industry.

IALA is currently in the process of standardizing MRN and we expect this to be finalized sometime in 2017. The first draft of our proposal for MRNs is up at <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-knielsen-mrn-urn-01>.

We welcome comments and contributions either by signing up to our discussion group at <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mrn-discuss> or by emailing us directly at (<info@mrnregistry.org>).

## What is Maritime Resource Names
Maritime Resource Names (MRN) is a naming scheme that can uniquely identify any maritime resource on a global scale. By maritime resource we basically mean anything that has an identity of some kind. This could be organizations, employees, a person, a physical or a virtual object, for instance an electronic document, a buoy, a ship, a mariner, a nautical chart or an electronic service (e.g., "today’s weather report for the Oresund Strait"). Not all resources are "retrievable" in an electronic sense; For example, human beings, corporations, and buoys. However, they can still be considered a resource.

Our [original paper](http://mrnregistry.org/Maritime%20Resource%20Name.docx) was presented at the [17th IALA Conference](http://www.iala-aism.org/meetings/17/).

<http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-nielsen-mrn-urn-01.txt> provides a more detailed explanation of the concept and a number of examples.

## Applying for a Namespace
Since we are still in the process of finalizing the standard and there are no formal process for applying for a namespace yet. However, if you wish to make use of MRNs in your project please contact us at <info@mrnregistry.org> and tell us a bit about your project and what subnamespace you wish to use.

## Who is using it
We are currently getting some experience using MRNs in the following projects
